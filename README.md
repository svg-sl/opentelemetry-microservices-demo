## This repo was modified and it is used to demonstrate OpenTelemetry capabilities
All the services had their OpenCensus, Cloud Operations (Stackdriver) removed. Only OpenTelemetry Traces were added.

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application + 1 Load Generator. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses the original application to demonstrate use of technologies like Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google Kubernetes Engine. It’s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.
You can find the one used by Google here: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo

## Quickstart (GKE)

If you'd like to follow Google's quickstart to deploy the sample in GKE,  please refer to [the original repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo#quickstart-gke).    
This repository will work with skaffold in the same way.  

## Quickstart (Local with Docker)
**Docker is required.**  
If you want to test it locally without a kubernetes cluster, you can follow the steps below.

1. **Clone this repository.**

```
git clone https://github.com/julianocosta89/opentelemetry-microservices-demo.git
cd opentelemetry-microservices-demo
```

2. **Build and run the containers.**  
We can simply use the script [hack/build-and-run.sh.](hack/build-and-run.sh) for this.  
The script requires a TAG as parameter to build all container images and run them in a docker network called `online-boutique`.  

```
TAG=1.0.0 ./hack/build-and-run.sh
```

3. **Wait for the containers to be ready.**  
The first time you run the previous command it takes some minutes to build everything.  
Once it finishes, you can check the running containers:
```
docker ps
```

You should see:
```

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 10 microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC. Plus one Load Generator which uses Locust to fake user traffic.  
See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io):**  
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally , as well as on the cloud).
- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com):**  
  This forked sample can also be executed only with Docker.
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):**  
  Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):**  
  Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenTelemetry Traces](https://opentelemetry.io):**  
  All services are instrumented using OpenTelemetry available instrumentation libraries.
- **[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started):**  
  All services are instrumented and sending the generated traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector via gRPC. The received traces are then exported to the logs and to Jaeger.
- **[Jager](https://www.jaegertracing.io):**  
  All generated traces are being sent to Jaeger.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):**  
  Application is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:**  
  The application demo comes with a background job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
